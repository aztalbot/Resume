# Printing
The resume is meant to be printed. When the print dialog is activated, styling changes for printing. However, some tweaks are still needed in the print dialog for optimum results. In Chrome, it's best to uncheck header/footer, and set margin to custom. Margins should be 0" on all sides except the right, which should be 0.13". Here is a link to the output [pdf](https://aztalbot.github.io/Resume/pdf/TalbotCV.pdf).

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install
